_More extensive readme TBD._

For local testing, you will need to create a `configuration.json` file and add the following key/value pairs: 
1. Your API Key from https://api.congress.gov/sign-up/ 
1. The specific Congress's data you want to retrieve, specified by that Congress's number input as a `STRING` (`"117"` is current as of 2025/02/24):

```
{
    "api_key": "API_KEY",
    "congress_number": "117"
}
```
